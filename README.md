# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

# Summary
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone for 30 volunteers.

# R Script Description
My R script, called run_analysis.R, does the following:
 - Downloads the zipped data file and uploads the training and test data sets into R
 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
